Dreamhost DNS updater
=====================

This is a simple script to keep a given domain name always pointing to your current IP, 
basically turning DreamHost into a dynamic DNS provider, similar to no-ip.com or dyn.com.


It uses [Dreamhost's API](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/API) and a copy of 
[node-heroku-ip-service](https://github.com/nfriedly/node-whats-my-ip) hosted at 
http://ip.nfriedly.com/

Usage
-----

Warning: this is still a work in progress, I haven't even tried these instructions yet.

First install it

    npm install node-dreamhost-dns-updater
    
Now get a Dreamhost API key with "All dns functions" from https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=home.api  

Run it once to make sure it works:

    update-dreamhost-dns --api_key YOUR_DH_API_KEY --domain my-computer.example.com
    
Note: it will fail if you target a subdomain that is currently a CNAME record. 
In that case, delete the subdomain and then try again.

Assuming that went well, set it in a cronjob and forget about it. Here's an example that 
runs the script every 5 minutes:

	# Minute   Hour   Day of Month       Month          Day of Week        Command    
	# (0-59)  (0-23)     (1-31)    (1-12 or Jan-Dec)  (0-6 or Sun-Sat)                
    	*/5      *         *              *               *                update-dreamhost-dns --api_key YOUR_DH_API_KEY --domain my-computer.example.com

On Windows, you can set up a Scheduled Task with the same command.

On Mac you can alternatively download the excellent [SleepWatcher](http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/) 
and make it run any time you computer wakes from sleep.
